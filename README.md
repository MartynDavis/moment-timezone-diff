A javascript library for displaying information about different timezones, utilising [moment](http://momentjs.com/) and [moment-timezone](http://momentjs.com/timezone/).

If you have a distributed team, you can easily display the current time for each team member
and answer questions such as:
- If the time for me, in Melbourne, Australia, is 2 pm this Sunday, what is the time for John, in New Zealand, & Jane, in Paris, France.
- If the time for John is 5 pm Friday fortnight, what is the time for me and Jane.
